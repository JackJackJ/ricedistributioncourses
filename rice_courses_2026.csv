Using lectures, discussions, films, and video presentations, this course explores Hip Hop culture's religious dimensions through its musical language-rap music."
AAAS 200,INTRO TO AAAS,Distribution Group I,,3,"An exploration of the origins and development of African Studies and African American Studies. Through a focus on the articulation and resolution of field-changing debates, the course introduces students to methodologies and practices that have led to and that continue to lead to knowing Africa and African-descendent people with earnest regard for the complexity and subtlety that the subjects require."
AAAS 204,BLACK ART IN AMERICA,Distribution Group I,,3,"This class examines the history of Black art in America since the early 1900s. What is Black Art? Who are the artists, curators, scholars, and theorists who have asked and answered this question over the decades? Is a Black aesthetic inherently revolutionary and interested in the political lives of black people and their liberation? Or is a Black aesthetic best exemplified by the manipulation of materials, visual composition, and saturation? Or both? We will engage theories of black art and aesthetics that emerged in the 1920s through today to take seriously the question: how does the visual life of blackness matter? In this class we will break through the traditional rhetoric of diversity and representation and discuss how artists over the decades have insisted instead on redistributions of power, radical and speculative material practices, and structural change. It is my priority to make this course on black aesthetics joyous, safe, and accessible to students of all genders, sexualities, and disabilities."
AAAS 210,INTRO AFRICAN RELIGIONS,Distribution Group I,Analyzing Diversity Course,3,"Introduction to the structures of African religions through readings.

AAAS 211,AFRICAN MODERNISM,Distribution Group I,,3,"This course introduces students to the modern art of Africa, drawing attention to its variants in the continent’s different local and regional geographies. Defined by art historian Clement Emeka Akpang (2016) as the intersection of art with political and social concerns, the era of modernism marked a phase of great experimentation in art characterised by the introduction of new ideas, new media, and a shift in the materiality and many other aspects of art. As such, African artists were part of it, yet as Partha Mitter (2008) argues, the discourse of modernism, is an ‘unmarked case’ that implicitly stands for ‘Western’ modernism. In the course, students will cover different aspects of African modernism discourses drawing from literature and artworks from at least each of the continent’s major regions. The main objective is to gain insights into Africa’s contribution to global art. Besides the few celebrated African modernists known in the West, by the end of the course students will have amassed considerable knowledge of more artists ‘on the other side of modernity’ as these will be highlighted throughout the course."
AAAS 217,RELIGION & BLACK LIVES MATTER,Distribution Group I,Analyzing Diversity Course,3,"This course explores the intersections of religion, politics, and social justice during the period of history marked by the emergence and activities of the Black Lives Matter Movement."

Thus, students will become familiar with systems, ideologies, and terms such as slavery, apartheid, socialism and communism in Africa, Pan-Africanism, Black Consciousness, female suicide bombers, neo-colonialism, and the psychological encounter between the colonized and colonizer."
AAAS 225,DYNAMICS OF EMPIRE,Distribution Group I,,3,"The arrival of the Portuguese in Africa in the 15th century marked the beginning of European oceanic expansion, a movement that profoundly shaped the modern world. This expansion introduced dichotomous dynamics of center and periphery, along with new global relations rooted in racial hierarchies, often resulting in violent consequences for African peoples. Despite these oppressive systems, resistant voices have emerged and continue to grow as African people strive to redefine Blackness. This seminar covers key topics such as the Transatlantic Slave Trade, the development of African diasporic communities, colonialism in Africa, and Afro-Atlantic intellectual and ideological exchanges. We will also explore contemporary representations and mobilizations of Black culture and identity. Through critical readings and engaging discussions of prose, poetry, film, and music, we will analyze imperialism's history and enduring legacies."

AAAS 279,BLACK SCI-FI,Distribution Group I,Analyzing Diversity Course,3,"This course examines how black science and speculative fiction worries the division between reality and fantasy; challenges the fictions embedded in our national histories; and underscores the social, economic, and political inequities short-circuiting the lives of brown and black peoples around the world. Focusing on works from Octavia Butler to Victor Levalle, from George Schuyler to Mat Johnson, from John Williams to Colson Whitehead among others, the course engages the ways in which these authors represent the monstrous and grotesque; pandemics, environmental and technological degradation and catastrophe; urbanization, gentrification, and immigration; and (biological/technological) warfare, in order to recalibrate our understanding of the central role race plays in determining both access to, and allocation of, necessary resources. We will track the histories and afterlives of slavery and colonialism that continue to transfigure our society, while also studying varied blueprints for, and critiques of, alternative, more egalitarian societies imagined by these artists."

AAAS 308,BLACK VISUAL CULTURE,Distribution Group I,,3,"From Beyoncè’s ""Lemonade"" to Kendrick Lamar’s “They Not Like Us,” black visual and sonic culture have defined and shaped the American cultural landscape.

From music videos to performance art, “Black Visual Culture: From Lemonade to They Not Like Us” examines the Black visual culture of the 2000s, placing contemporary modes of visual representation in dialogue with sculpture, painting and other “fine arts.” It is our priority to make this course joyous, safe, and accessible to students of all genders, sexualities, and disabilities."
AAAS 311,REPRESENTATIONS OF DISABILITY,Distribution Group I,,3,"How has disability been represented in different realms of our social lives? What do these representations say about our “ideal” or desired future? How are representations of disabilities shaping and are shaped by the concept of futurity? How are race, sexuality, gender, and disability intertwined in these visions of the future and its representations? Drawing upon artistic, mediatic, and medical representations of disability we will examine the ways disability, in its intersections with blackness, queerness and transness, are crucial for thinking about human difference and to disturbing normative arrangements. Students will be encouraged to think critically through an interdisciplinary approach that relies on the contributions of different fields, including Disability Studies, Crip Studies, Black Studies, Medical Anthropology, and Queer and Trans Studies."

AAAS 366,RADICAL BLACK THOUGHT IN ART,Distribution Group I,,3,"Citations can be a radical form of collective activism and liberation.

In this class, students will have the opportunity to interact with visual and performance artists. We will take field trips into the studio spaces of Houston-based artists in order to ask questions about who they cite and why.

GERM 307,FOLK & FAIRY TALE IN GERMAN,Distribution Group I,,3,"The folk tales collected by the Brothers Grimm still exhibit all the principle characteristics and functions of oral literature, i.e. the reproduction of an audience's cultural identity and the securing of that identity. Nevertheless, these characteristics are still preserved in fairy tales written by specific authors for a reading audience. Examples of the latter are mainly from authors of Romanticism and Realism. Taught in German."
GERM 309,GERMAN POETRY,Distribution Group I,,3,"""If the soul speaks out, alas! it is no longer the soul that speaks"" - in Schiller's famous line one of the many fascinating paradoxes of lyric poetry is expressed. With the tradition of the ""Lied,"" poems set to music, German poetry of the Classical-Romantic epoch was soon to become the epitome of lyric poetry as such. There were, however, poems of quite different kinds before and after Goethe, Eichendorff, and Heine.

After the fall of the wall, Berlin is still looking for its role in the center of a reshaped Europe.

GERM 332,NEW GERM FILM: HITLER'S CINEMA,Distribution Group I,,3,"From the 1960s to 2000, Germany developed a very distinct auteur cinema with independent filmmakers such as Fassbinder, Herzog, Wenders, Kluge, Adlon, von Trotta, Sander, Brueckner, Garnier, Tykwer, and others. The first twenty years were oriented toward coming to terms with the fascist past; the second twenty years focused on more contemporary issues, including terrorism, misogyny, and xenophobia. To explore these issues, we will discuss the work of four major directors of the New German Cinema, whose films are concerned with pressing political questions as well as their own nature as “films.” To further our discussions of the politics and aesthetics of visual media in general and of film in particular, the screenings will be put into dialogue with short, often canonical, theoretical texts. Mutually exclusive with and formerly offered as GERM 338. Students cannot earn credit for GERM 332 if they have received credit for GERM 338."

GERM 335,GERMAN FILM (IN ENGLISH),Distribution Group I,,3,"The course explores filmic representations of communities, their complex mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion, their inevitable dynamics of otherness, as well as practices of modern states toward communal regulation and control. While communities biologically denote the interaction of organisms sharing an environment, we will examine the practices of power that states wield toward the maximization of “life.” Hence the questions of biopower, health politics, eugenics, sexism, racism, and genocide. How do films negotiate the precarious politics of communal life, what are their strategies for resistance, and what their moments of complicity? We will explore how film reflects communal life in twentieth-century German history, but also, and perhaps primarily, how film responds to that history by generating its own speaking power and mobilizing its own political force."
GERM 336,NATIONAL SOCIALISM AND FILM,Distribution Group I,,3,"This course explores films made in Nazi Germany as well as films about Nazi Germany and the corresponding crisis of justice in the mid-twentieth century. We will analyze cinematic responses to the rise of the fascist movement, World War II, the Holocaust, and the post-war years.

Taught in English."
GERM 345,"GERMAN HISTORY, 1890-1945",Distribution Group I,,3,"From 1890-1945, Germans experienced dramatic changes in their political environment.

Taught in English."
GERM 352,THE POLITICS OF THE FLESH,Distribution Group I,,3,"This course will introduce students to the complex relation between the sphere of politics and the human body as negotiated in German literature, thought and film.

HART 204,BLACK ART IN AMERICA,Distribution Group I,,3,"This class examines the history of Black art in America since the early 1900s. What is Black Art? Who are the artists, curators, scholars, and theorists who have asked and answered this question over the decades? Is a Black aesthetic inherently revolutionary and interested in the political lives of black people and their liberation? Or is a Black aesthetic best exemplified by the manipulation of materials, visual composition, and saturation? Or both? We will engage theories of black art and aesthetics that emerged in the 1920s through today to take seriously the question: how does the visual life of blackness matter? In this class we will break through the traditional rhetoric of diversity and representation and discuss how artists over the decades have insisted instead on redistributions of power, radical and speculative material practices, and structural change. It is my priority to make this course on black aesthetics joyous, safe, and accessible to students of all genders, sexualities, and disabilities."
HART 205,ART SINCE 1945,Distribution Group I,,3,"This course introduces the major developments, figures, and works of late modernism beginning with the shift, during the 1940s, from Paris to New York as the cultural center of avant-garde.

HART 211,AFRICAN MODERNISM,Distribution Group I,,3,"This course introduces students to the modern art of Africa, drawing attention to its variants in the continent’s different local and regional geographies. Defined by art historian Clement Emeka Akpang (2016) as the intersection of art with political and social concerns, the era of modernism marked a phase of great experimentation in art characterised by the introduction of new ideas, new media, and a shift in the materiality and many other aspects of art. As such, African artists were part of it, yet as Partha Mitter (2008) argues, the discourse of modernism, is an ‘unmarked case’ that implicitly stands for ‘Western’ modernism. In the course, students will cover different aspects of African modernism discourses drawing from literature and artworks from at least each of the continent’s major regions. The main objective is to gain insights into Africa’s contribution to global art. Besides the few celebrated African modernists known in the West, by the end of the course students will have amassed considerable knowledge of more artists ‘on the other side of modernity’ as these will be highlighted throughout the course."
HART 212,WOMEN ARTISTS IN LATIN AMERICA,Distribution Group I,,3,"This course examines the contribution of women artists to the history of art in Latin America in the twentieth century.

HART 228,INTRO TO A HIST OF ARCHITECT,Distribution Group I,,3,"This course will explore cities, deemed ideal, and buildings, deemed canonic, that operate as imaginary objects and that, all too often, pass as exemplary models to be emulated, be it as social machines, technical accomplishments, or expressions of cultural, if not political, desires."
HART 230,EARLY MEDIEVAL,Distribution Group I,,3,"This course is an introductory approach to the art of the medieval world from the rise of Christian art in the third century to the crystallization of the medieval artistic traditions in the tenth century.

We will also look to the Silk Empire as well. Many forms of artistic expression will be considered, with special attention to architecture, monumental painting and sculpture, book illumination, and work in precious metals. The chief purpose of this course is to help you develop a language with which to speak about and intelligently discuss early medieval art.

Formerly offered as HART 330. Students cannot receive credit for HART 230 if the student has previously taken HART 330."
HART 231,LATER MEDIEVAL,Distribution Group I,,3,"This course will follow the development of art and architecture of Gothic Europe and the neighboring Byzantine and Islamic cultures from the twelfth century to the fourteenth.

We will investigate the media associated with European, Byzantine, and Islamic artistic production, such as architecture, sculpture, mosaics, painting, stained glass, and manuscript illumination. In addition to examining the visual elements of these different creations, we will also discuss their socio-political context.

Careful consideration will be given to historical and cultural contexts, including mythological and religious traditions, intercultural connections, and changing artistic standards and practices."
HART 308,BLACK VISUAL CULTURE,Distribution Group I,,3,"From Beyoncè’s ""Lemonade"" to Kendrick Lamar’s “They Not Like Us,” black visual and sonic culture have defined and shaped the American cultural landscape. But how do we read and interrogate the visuals that have accompanied these sonic revolutions? From music videos to performance art, “Black Visual Culture: From Lemonade to They Not Like Us” examines the Black visual culture of the 2000s, placing contemporary modes of visual representation in dialogue with sculpture, painting and other “fine arts.” It is our priority to make this course joyous, safe, and accessible to students of all genders, sexualities, and disabilities."
HART 311,REPRESENTATIONS OF DISABILITY,Distribution Group I,,3,"How has disability been represented in different realms of our social lives? What do these representations say about our “ideal” or desired future? How are representations of disabilities shaping and are shaped by the concept of futurity? How are race, sexuality, gender, and disability intertwined in these visions of the future and its representations? Drawing upon artistic, mediatic, and medical representations of disability we will examine the ways disability, in its intersections with blackness, queerness and transness, are crucial for thinking about human difference and to disturbing normative arrangements.

HART 318,AFRICAN DIASPORA STUDIES,Distribution Group I,,3,"How are transnational black communities creating, imagining and reimagining the African Diaspora? African Diaspora Studies offers a framework and set of theoretical interventions for understanding the lives of black people across the globe. As a field of study, it asks what is the historical effect and after-life of several centuries of forced displacement, dispossession and expatriation of millions of Africans. This cross-oceanic transfer of people, labor, capital, ideas, and goods has given rise to a way of thinking about and imaging identity, belonging, and movement that shift away from national identity and frameworks that hinge on the centrality of the nation-state."

HUMA 120,WHERE IS UTOPIA?,Distribution Group I,,3,"Where is utopia? Thomas More’s original coinage, suggesting both “good place” and “no place,” might give little cause for hope, but that hasn’t stopped visionaries, scientists, artists and scholars from seeking it out over the years. It might be in our past, or just ahead. We might be there now, if only we knew how to look: under the pavement, we might find the beach. Or utopia might be off our planet entirely. Ideals shape societies; scientific research, architecture, city planning and cultural production all attest to the hopes and values that spawned them. But as we consider the fallout of past utopian efforts, corollary questions present themselves: do we even want to find utopia? Does every “perfect” society imply a dystopian counterpart? Who is utopia for, and who is excluded? This course will explore utopia through the work of scientists, architects, artists and art movements. Classes will fall into three categories: lectures and reading discussions; field trips; and group art projects. These latter Learning Lab projects will encourage students to work together and apply the readings, discussions and artistic precedents towards their own visions of utopia."
HUMA 121,IS ALL THE WORLD A STAGE?,Distribution Group I,,3,"We seem to find or make theater wherever we look. In halls and on stages, but also in Senate chambers and check-out lines - not to mention online. In the small rooms of houses and on small screens of reality television programming. Whether streaming or tweeting, drama is everywhere. What is drama such that it enjoys such intensity and ubiquity? Is it an overflow of energy that creates authenticity? An artificially heightened state (as in “too much drama”)? A carefully crafted manipulation (as in “political drama”)? A way of being in space? A cultural habit? This course considers why theater is so central to our idioms and cultural practices even for people who have never seen, much less set foot on, a proscenium stage. We’ll explore the many senses of drama central to social behavior by witnessing the long transit of theater from the classical amphitheater to just about anywhere. The course is designed to offer an introduction to the history and conventions of theatrical practice, from the ancient theater to 21st-century immersive and site-specific performance, which will offer a lens for understanding the drama of human interaction that spills out everywhere. Class sessions will include: 1) lecture/discussions about the histories of theater and languages of performance; 2) Learning Lab sessions that allow students to create their own personal theatrical experience with a combination of acting and directing exercises, live performance experiences, and conversations with theater professionals; and 3) theater of the everyday exercises inviting students to look at the world from the point of view of theatrical experience. No previous theater experience or training required."
HUMA 122,WHO SHOULD VOTE?,Distribution Group I,,3,"Questions surrounding the ballot box are as contested today as they have ever been in the history of our democracy. Using methods from multiple humanities disciplines, in this course we will explore questions such as: Should voting be required? Should the voting age be changed? Should felons forfeit their ability to vote, or do even prisoners have a right to participate in elections? Should voting be easier to do, or do more requirements protect the integrity of the ballot? Should non-citizens also be able to vote, at least some of the time? Should the Electoral College be reformed? Can the study of the past help us think about big questions in the present?"
HUMA 123,WHO WHAT WHY IS DISNEY?,Distribution Group I,,3,"This course will engage students with three questions: WHO is Disney (as an artist and as an entrepreneur and creator of iconic figures and films)? WHAT is the Disney Corporation and how has it grown and evolved?WHY does the current configuration of Disney as global culture giant exist and why does it matter (in the lives of those it touches across the world, but also especially with regard to Disney's patents, copyrights and trademarks)?The course will cover the formation of Disney and its use of fairy tales and folk culture to build its narratives. It will cover the building of Disneyland and its utopian project of transforming theme parks and building a world around storytelling. It will cover the movement of Disney in the forefront of film production in the 1980s through its Touchstone imprint and through the utilization of digital animation technology. Finally, the course will discuss the current triumphal corporate world of Disney Plus, and the ownership of an immense set of copyrights, patents, and trademarks.

HUMA 124,IS THIS THE END?,Distribution Group I,,3,"Is this the end? The end of our planet, truth, certainty? This course explores this question via contemporary writing across the world. Taught from a global perspective, the course will examine writers’ responses to major topics of our age, among others, truth, climate change, and borders."
HUMA 125,WHAT IS ETHICAL: BIG QUESTIONS,Distribution Group I,,3,"“What is the ethical thing to do?” can be interpreted in various ways. What rules do ethical theories prescribe? What reasons can be given for and against different ethical theories? How have different ethical theories been developed – where do they come from? What binding force, if any, do ethical theories have? And, most importantly, how should we live? What does ethical reflection about our lives and our practices reveal? Students will be introduced to theoretical ethics and practical ethics. In Part One, roughly the first 8-9 weeks of the course, they will study classic works in philosophical ethics – and contemporary responses to them. They will learn philosophical arguments for and against these ethical theories. Guest lecturers will shed light on historical circumstances that led to their formation and on cross-cultural comparisons. In Part Two, roughly the last 6-7 weeks of the course, they will work through two topics in practical ethics: the treatment of animals and reparations for slavery. The course will conclude with an Ethics Lab, in which students work in small groups to gather information on a chosen topic in practical ethics and analyze it from the perspective of different ethical theories."
HUMA 126,WHAT IS THE MEANING OF DEATH?,Distribution Group I,,3,"This course will ask students to learn and reflect on theoretical positions on death from historical and contemporary philosophers, but will also place a heavy emphasis on developing a student’s own attitude toward death as not just a topic for theoretical and abstract discussion, but a phenomenon that they must inevitably encounter in their own lives. Thus, the philosophical material will be supplemented with poetry, film, literature, and personal essays from non-philosophers: material that will enrich their own thoughts as they try to determine the respect in which they agree or disagree with the philosophical perspectives on offer. One goal is to have the students recognize the extent to which philosophical reflection, and engaging with the humanities, can influence and deepen their perception and understanding of their lives."
HUMA 127,WHAT IS HATE?,Distribution Group I,,3,"What is Hate?. Hate can be an emotion, an action, a belief, an ideology. It can manifest itself with great passion, or become normalized so that it isn’t even recognized as such –perhaps seen, instead, as an expression of “how things are.” This course gathers strands from diverse disciplines, in order to present a cohesive examination of “hate as a system” undermining civic life, and even the cultural and intellectual vitality of society. We will examine the unsettling question of “hatred” through scholarly works, literary expressions, and visual culture dealing with prejudice, discrimination, extreme nationalistic movements, racism, and genocide. Along with these academic and artistic explorations, we will advance into the realm of engaged humanities and activism, through a series of presentations by scholars and advocates. The class will benefit from presentations by faculty and guest speakers from our university (the Boniuk Institute for Religious Tolerance, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion), and the larger Houston community (Houston Coalition Against Hate, Anti-Defamation League, ACLU, etc.)."
HUMA 128,WHY DID SO MANY DIE?,Distribution Group I,,3,"The U.S. response to the pandemic has been a disaster, and will end (if it ends!) with hundreds of thousands dead and tens of millions infected. How did this happen, and who is to blame? The main facts are now largely clear. But how to interpret them is another matter. Is this a story about how China blew up the whole world by being unwilling to admit it was facing a scary epidemic back in December and January? Is it a story about how the White House allowed Americans to die in the name of “saving the economy”? Is it a story about how selfish individuals went to the beach rather than suffer for the collective good, or a story about institutions that worked poorly? Is it all these things? We need to look back and make sense of this calamity."
HUMA 129,WHO IS A TERRORIST?,Distribution Group I,,3,Who is a terrorist? Does it depend on the religion of the perpetrator? Why are some killings of innocent people widely discussed as terrorism while others are not? What is the relationship between the discourse of terrorism and the actual objective history of violence that the term obscures?
HUMA 130,WHAT IS A CLASSIC?,Distribution Group I,,3,"""Outmoded works by dead, white European males” would be one answer. “Living, multi-racial, global, and genderqueer” would be another. This course explores the classic as a protean thing, made and remade by an enormous range of creative and critical responses that reshape both it and the cultures in which those responses arise."
HUMA 131,WHAT IS AN (AB)NORMAL BODY?,Distribution Group I,Analyzing Diversity Course,3,"This course introduces the history of science and medicine through disabilities studies literature. The course centers around the guiding question, “What is an (ab)normal body?” Students will better articulate the body as a social, political, and corporeal construct by engaging with this question.

HUMA 324,"BERLIN:RESIDENCE,METRO,CAPITAL",Distribution Group I,,3,"The course offers an introduction to German history, politics, and culture as mirrored in the history of the old and new German capital. Berlin has always been a city of contradictions: from imperial glamour to proletarian slums, from the Roaring Twenties to Hitler's seizure of power. Emerging from the ruins of WWII Berlin became both the capital of Socialism and the display window of the Free World. After the fall of the wall, Berlin is still looking for its role in the center of a reshaped Europe.

JWST 130,ANTI-SEMITISM AND ISLAMOPHOBIA,Distribution Group I,,3,"In a world saturated with competing narratives about anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, it can be hard to sort facts from fiction. Often, it's difficult to even understand what we're talking about. Where do these forms of discrimination come from? Are they about race? Religion? Ethnicity? Perhaps something else entirely? In this course, we'll address these questions using a variety of disciplines and by looking at a range of sources, from literature and films to works of philosophy and political theory. We'll turn our attention back to medieval Spain and move all the way through contemporary debates about the Holocaust, the State of Israel, and the War on Terror. By the end, students will have a rich knowledge of the various forms these ideas have taken, how and why they are intrinsically related to one another, and how they have evolved in the present. If you’re interested in understanding more about our current world and how it came to be, this class will build a strong foundation for engaging in historically informed critical dialogue on today's pressing social issues."
JWST 201,GREAT BOOKS OF JEWISH CULTURE,Distribution Group I,,3,"The Jewish people have often understood themselves as the “people of the book,” because of the Jewish tradition’s reliance on texts and textual study as a central component of religious culture and practice. This course will take the idea of the book as a starting point for a survey of Jewish history and culture. Spanning the biblical period to the present, we will read primary texts important to Jewish life and culture as well as scholarship from disciplines as varied as religion, history, anthropology, sociology, comparative literature, philosophy, and gender and sexuality studies. In doing so, we will learn about the varied communities that produced these texts; the languages they spoke and read; their particular religious and cultural practices; and how they have understood themselves in the context of other social and political communities over time, including in the ancient, medieval, and modern eras."
JWST 224,RACE AND RELIGION,Distribution Group I,,3,"There is no shortage of critical engagement with the idea of race and its role in shaping modern history and politics. Rarely, however, do we think about religion as an important part of that story. Economics, public policy, history, literature, and science have all developed various perspectives on this question, but religion is often left aside in these conversations. This course looks closely at the intersection of race and religion and the ways these two ideas have been deeply entangled in the modern and even ancient worlds. We will ask whether it makes sense to talk about race in antiquity and the Middle Ages, prior to its scientific invention; we will explore the links between race and Christianity; and we will interrogate how various groups, including Jews, Muslims, and Black people understood themselves within the discourses of race and religion. By examining these two ideas in relation to one another, this course offers a richer understanding of the history and evolution of racial ideas and their continued resonance in the present."
JWST 230,TRANSCULTURAL COMICS,Distribution Group I,,3,"This course offers a diverse survey of comics and graphic novels from the early days of comics to present graphic novels.

Our exploration of the genesis of comics will focus on the centrality of Jewish-American figures in this “golden age.” Our investigation of current developments will look back at the influence of the civil rights-, women rights-, and LGBTQ rights movements on the development of 1970s underground comix, and the traces of underground comix in the diversity of 21st century graphic novels. We will address themes as immigration and assimilation, race and ethnicity, sexuality and gender, trauma and memory. An overarching theme will be the inherent hybridity of the medium, and how it serves narratives related to small or disenfranchised communities and offers their authors a unique form of expression."
JWST 317,JEWISH GRAPHIC NOVEL,Distribution Group I,,3,"This course will examine contemporary works that combine image and text to depict Jewish history, culture, community, and identity in the form of the graphic novel."

Is music a “universal language”? Why does music so powerfully affect our emotions? Why are some sounds pleasing and others are not? Our goal in this class is to explore what scientific approaches to these questions can tell us about the place of science in the modern world—as well as how and why science has become so important to our imagining of ourselves as thinking, feeling, and willing beings.

As the potential applications of DNA to our social life increasingly appear endless, this course asks how is genetic information reshaping our understanding of the value of life itself? In addition to identifying markers, scientific knowledge production around genetic information is reconstituting key ideas of risk, care, capital that impact our ideas of disability, race, kinship, citizenship, nationalism, and justice. In this class, our aim is to ask a) what is historically and materially distinct about genetic information as a metaphor for social processes, b) how is the value of life itself being reproduced and transformed for whom, and c) what are potential consequences we face by relating to one another through the geneticization of social life?

These worldviews defined how you are supposed to interpret issues ranging from whether health care is a right to how we as a country should treat immigrants. How did we get here? Are the debates we are having the only ways to debate these issues, or do other countries have different kinds of political debates? In this class, we take a broader global view on four ethnographic and philosophical questions central to democracy that is being reconfigured by new forms of autocracy in different countries. These questions are: What does democratic representation involve? How does a nation become and stay democratic? What is a government’s obligations to its citizens? And lastly, what are a citizen’s obligations to their nation – what constitutes a model citizen? In this course, we are going to address all three questions from an ethnographic perspective, exploring the cultural assumptions that underlie different countries’ answers to these questions. We will explore how and when culture matters, asking whether political debates in Chile can ever be same as those in Kazakhstan or in the United States. In addition, we will examine how people discuss politics in the United States to look at what is American about politics here, paying particular attention to the assumptions inherent in public accounts of democracy in media, polling, congressional hearings, and so on."

This course provides a broad introduction to the field of linguistic and legal anthropology, its key concepts, and its methods through an exploration of “bad language” and semiotic crimes. We investigate a range of speech types—curses, oaths, insults, gossip, argument, taboo words, obscenities, blasphemy, slang—and the essential roles they play in our lives. At the same time, we develop a cross-cultural perspective by comparing our own notions of what counts as bad language with ways of speaking that others cultural groups consider rude, vulgar, and even dangerous. We will also explore how different societies set standards for pronunciation, word choice, spelling, speaking and writing, how those standards are enforced, and how/why they sometimes get contested or resisted.

While our scope is both geographically and temporally broad, specific case studies will be highlighted from Africa, Eurasia, North America, and the Pacific islands. The unifying thread among these case studies is a focus on lines of evidence, with the goal of exposing students to the diverse methods of archaeology: how can archaeologists determine the impacts of humans upon animals and vice versa, and how well are their interpretations supported by their data? Finally, we consider how knowledge of the past can help shape our approaches to animals and their environments today, with respect for the planet that we all share.
